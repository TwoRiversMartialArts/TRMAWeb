                            Two Rivers Martial Arts is a non-profit organization. All instructors are unpaid volunteers, which allows us to keep prices
                            low. Our instructors are all black belts, some of which have over 20 years of experience. A student
                            enrolled at any branch can attend as many classes as desired at any other branch with no additional
                            charge. The expectation is that each student choose a primary branch and instructor who will
                            guide the student's preparations for promotion tests.
