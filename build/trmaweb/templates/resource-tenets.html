                                        Needless to say, the success or failure of Tae Kwon Do
                                        training depends largely on how one observes and implements the Tenets
                                        of Tae Kwon Do which should serve as a guide for all serious students of the art.

                                        In Tae Kwon Do, the word integrity assumes a looser definition than the one usually presented in Webster's Dictionary. One
                                        must be able to define right and wrong and have the conscience, if wrong, to feel
                                        guilt. Listed are some examples, where integrity is lacking:
                                        <br>
                                        <br>The instructor who misrepresents himself and his art by presenting improper techniques
                                        to his students because of a lack of knowledge or apathy.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>The student who misrepresents himself by "fixing" breaking materials before demonstrations.
                                        <br>The instructor who camouflages bad techniques with luxurious training halls and false
                                        flattery to his students.
                                        <br>The student who requests rank from an instructor, or attempts to purchase it.
                                        <br>The student who gains rank for ego purposes or the feeling of power.
                                        <br>The instructor who teaches and promotes his art for materialistic gains.
                                        <br>The student whose actions do not live up to his words.
                                        <br>The student who feels ashamed to seek opinions from his juniors.

                                        There is an old Oriental saying, "Patience leads to virtue or merit." "One can make a peaceful home by being patient for
                                        100 times." Certainly, happiness and prosperity are most likely brought to the patient
                                        person to achieve something, whether it is a higher degree or the perfection of a
                                        technique, one must set his goal, then constantly persevere. Robert Bruce learned
                                        his lesson of perseverance from the persistent efforts of a lowly spider. It was
                                        this perseverance of tenacity that finally enabled him to free Scotland in the fourteenth
                                        century. One of the most important secrets in becoming a leader of Tae Kwon Do is
                                        to overcome every difficulty by perseverance.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Confucius said; "one who is impatient in trivial matters can seldom achieve success
                                        in matters of great importance."

                                        This tenet is extremely important inside and outside the do-jang, whether conducting oneself in free sparring or in one's
                                        personal affairs. A loss of self control in free sparring can prove disastrous to
                                        both student and opponent. An inability to live and work within one's capability
                                        or sphere is also a lack of self-control.

                                        <br>According to Lao-Tzu "the term of stronger is the person who wins over oneself rather

                                        "Here lie 300, who did their duty," a simple epitaph for one of the greatest acts of courage known to mankind.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>Although facing the superior forces of Xerxes, Leonidas and his 300 Spartans at Thermoplyae
                                        showed the world the meaning of indomitable spirit. It is shown when a courageous
                                        person and his principles are pitted against overwhelming odds.
                                        <br> A serious student of Tae Kwon Do will at all times be modest and honest. If confronted
                                        with injustice he will deal with the belligerent without any fear or hesitation at
                                        all, with indomitable spirit, regardless of whosoever and however many the number
                                        may be.
                                        <br>
                                        <br> Confucius declared: "it is an act of cowardice to fail to speak out against injustice."
                                        As history has proven, those who have pursued their dreams earnestly and strenuously
                                        with indomitable spirit have never failed to achieve their goals.
